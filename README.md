# CoSi

This repository implements the CoSi protocol for scalable collective signing.
CoSi enables authorities to have their statements collectively signed,
or *co-signed*, by a scalable group of independent parties or *witnesses*.
The signatures that CoSi produces convey the same information
as a list of conventional signatures from all participants,
but CoSi signatures are far more compact and efficient for clients to verify.
In practice, a CoSi collective signature is close to the same size as &mdash;
and comparable in verification costs to &mdash;
a *single* individual signature.

CoSi is intended to facilitate increased transparency and security-hardening
for critical Internet authorities such as certificate authorities,
[time services](http://www.nist.gov/pml/div688/grp40/its.cfm),
naming authorities such as [DNSSEC](http://www.dnssec.net),
software distribution and update services,
directory services used by tools such as [Tor](https://www.torproject.org),
and next-generation cryptocurrencies.

# Versions

There is a v0-version that you can use which is more stable than what is in this development-branch:

https://github.com/dedis/cosi/tree/v0

# Installation

You may install CoSi from either pre-built binaries
or from [Go](https://golang.org/) source code,
as described below.

## Installing from Binaries

For convenience we provide self-contained x86-64 binaries
for Linux and Mac OS X.
[Download the latest release](https://github.com/dedis/cosi/releases/latest),
untar it, and move the appropriate binary for your platform
into a directory that is in your `$PATH`.
The 'cosi'-script choses the correct binary for you.
If your `~/bin` is in the `$PATH`, you can do:

```bash
tar xf cosi-*tar.gz -C ~/bin
```

Now you can go on directly to *Command-line Interface*

## Installing from Source

To build and run CoSi from source code you will need to install
[Go](https://golang.org/) version 1.5.2 or later.
See
[the Go documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install)
on how to install and configure Go,
and make sure that
[`$GOPATH` and `$GOBIN` are set](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH).
Then you can fetch, update, compile and install the cosi-binary using:

```bash
go get -u github.com/dedis/cosi
```

The `cosi` binary will be installed in the directory indicated by `$GOBIN`.

# Command-line Interface

The `cosi` application provides both a client for signing messages,
and a server implementing the cosigner or witness-server role
in the CoSi protocol.

## Chose the Right Directory for the Examples

For the examples in the following sections, we suppose you're in a directory
where you can find the following files: `README.md` and `dedis-group.toml`.

If you compiled from source, please change the directory like so:

```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/dedis/cosi
```

If you used the binary distribution, please use

```bash
cd $( dirname $( which cosi ) )
```

## Collectively Signing Messages with the CoSi Client

In order to sign messages collectively, you first need to define the set of
cosigners that will participate.  To do this, you need to prepare a *group definition* 
file which lists the cosigners to use with their public keys and Internet addresses.
You may use [our default list of public CoSi
servers](https://github.com/dedis/cosi/blob/master/dedis_group.toml) if you wish, or define your own.

CoSi will by default search for a file "group.toml" in the default configuration folders
which are `$HOME/.config/cosi/` for Linux systems and `$HOME/Library/cosi/` for
mac systems. If CoSi did not find anything, the default mechanism is to search in the current
directory.

Once you have a valid group definition, you can sign a file using the `cosi signâ€™
command.  Here is an example that uses our default public CoSi server group to
sign the README.md file at the top of the cosi source directory:

```bash
cosi sign -g dedis_group.toml README.md
```

When collective signing completes,
the resulting signature will be written to standard output by default.
To write the signature written to a file,
you may redirect output or use the the `-o` option:

```base
cosi sign -g dedis_group.toml -o README.sig README.md
```

To verify a collective signature, use the `cosi verify` command:
  
```bash
cosi verify -g dedis_group.toml -s README.sig README.md
```

Verification can also take the signature from standard input:

```bash
cat README.sig | cosi verify -g dedis_group.toml README.md
```

In the current prototype, CoSi witness servers do not validate or check the 
messages you propose in any way; they merely serve to provide transparency
by publicly attesting the fact that they have observed and cosigned the message.
A future CoSi release will add support for message validation plugins,
by which the servers can apply application-specific checks to messages
before signing off on them,
e.g., to validate a [collectively signed blockchain](http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06997).

## Running Your Own CoSi Witness Server

First you need to create a configuration file for the server including a 
public/private key pair.
You can create a default server configuration with a fresh 
public/private key pair as follows:

```bash
cosi server setup
```

Follow the instructions on the screen. At the end, you should have two files:
* One local server configuration file which is used by your cothority server,
* One group definition file that you will share with other cothority members and
  clients that wants to contact you.

To run the server, simply type:
```bash
cosi server
```

### Custom Configuration Path

The server will try to read the default configuration file; if you have put the
file in a custom location, provide the path using:
```bash
cosi server -config path/file.toml
```

### Debugging Output

You can also ask the server to print out some debugging messages by indicating
a level. Using level 1 shows when a message gets signed:

```bash
cosi -d 1 server
```

## Creating a Collective Signing Group

If you run several CoSi servers,
you can concatenate their individual `group.toml` outputs
to define your own cosigning group.
You may optionally use any or all of our experimental
[default CoSi servers](https://github.com/dedis/cosi/blob/master/dedis_group.toml)
if you wish.
Your resulting `group.toml' file should look something like this:

```
Description = "My Test group"

[[servers]]
  Addresses = ["127.0.0.1:2000"]
  Public = "6T7FwlCuVixvu7XMI9gRPmyCuqxKk/WUaGbwVvhA+kc="
  Description = "Local Server 1"

[[servers]]
  Addresses = ["127.0.0.1:2001"]
  Public = "Aq0mVAeAvBZBxQPC9EbI8w6he2FHlz83D+Pz+zZTmJI="
  Description = "Local Server 2"
```

Your specific list will be different, of course,
especially in the specific IP addresses and public keys.
If you run multiple servers on the same machine for experimentation,
they must of course be assigned different ports,
e.g., 2000 and 2001 in the example above.
 
## Checking the Status of a Cosigning Group

You may use the `cosi check` command to
verify the availability and operation
of the servers listed in a group definition file:

```bash
cosi check -g dedis_group.toml
```

This will first contact each server individually, then make a small cothority-
group of all possible pairs of servers.
If there are connectivity problems,
due to firewalls or bad connections for example,
you will see a "Timeout on signing" or similar error message.


# Standalone Language-specific Verification/Signing Modules

The CoSi client and server software implemented in this repository is intended
to provide a scalable, robust distributed protocol for generating collective
signatures - but you do not always need a full distributed protocol to work
with CoSi signatures.  In particular, applications that wish to accept and
rely on CoSi signatures as part of some other protocol - e.g., a software
update daemon or certificate checking library - will typically need only a
small signature verification module, preferably written in (or with bindings
for) the language the relying application is written in.

Following is a list of pointers to standalone language-specific CoSi signature
verification modules available for use in applications this way, typically
implemented as an extension of an existing ed25519 implementation for that
language.  Pointers to more such standalone modules will be added for other
languages as we or others create them.  Some of these standalone modules also
include (limited) CoSi signature creation support.  We hope that eventually
some or all of these CoSi signature handling extensions will be merged back
into the base crypto libraries they were derived from.  Note that the
repositories below are experimental, likely to change, and may disappear
if/when they get successfully upstreamed.

* C language, signature verification only: in [temporary fork of libsodium](https://github.com/bford/libsodium).
See the new `crypto_sign_ed25519_verify_cosi` function in the
[crypto_sign/ed25519/ref10](https://github.com/bford/libsodium/blob/master/src/libsodium/crypto_sign/ed25519/ref10/open.c)
module, and the test suites for CoSi signature verification in
[libsodium/test/default/sign.c](https://github.com/bford/libsodium/blob/master/test/default/sign.c).
Run `make check` as usual for libsodium to run all tests including these.
* Go language, verification and signing code: in
[temporary fork of golang.org/x/crypto](https://github.com/bford/golang-x-crypto).
See the new [ed25519/cosi] package, with
[extensive godoc API documentation here](https://godoc.org/github.com/bford/golang-x-crypto/ed25519/cosi).
Run `go test` to run the standard test suite, and `go test -bench=.` to run a
suite of performance benchmarks for this package.
